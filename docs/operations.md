# Operations runbook

All commands run from the repo checkout on z8g4 (e.g. `/opt/stacks/aibrarian`).
`dc` below is short for `docker compose`.

## Daily glance

- Dashboard: `http://z8g4:8790/dashboard` (stage cards, failures, ETA)
- Prefect: `http://z8g4:4200` (flow runs, schedules, retries)
- Grafana: the "aibrarian" dashboard (import `docker/grafana/aibrarian-dashboard.json`)
- From the CLI: `dc exec aibrarian-api aibrarian status`

## Services

| Service | Port | Health |
|---|---|---|

| aibrarian-gpu | metrics 9109 | `dc logs -f aibrarian-gpu`, `nvidia-smi` shows whisper on GPU0 |
| aibrarian-worker | metrics 9108 | `dc logs -f aibrarian-worker` |
| prefect-server | 4200 | `curl z8g4:4200/api/health` |
| postgres | internal | `dc exec postgres pg_isready` |
| qdrant | 6333/6334 | `curl z8g4:6333/collections` |
| ollama | 11434 | `curl z8g4:11434/api/tags` |

## Common tasks

| I want to… | Do |
|---|---|
| see why an item failed | dashboard → *failed* card → click the row; or `aibrarian timeline <id>` |
| retry all failures | `dc exec aibrarian-api aibrarian retry-failed` (or run the `retry-failed` deployment in Prefect) |
| retry one item | `curl -X POST z8g4:8790/media/<id>/retry` |
| run one step by hand | `curl -X POST z8g4:8790/media/<id>/actions/probe` |
| kick the pipeline now | Prefect UI → `media-pipeline` → Run, or `dc exec aibrarian-gpu aibrarian pipeline` |
| rescan the disks now | Prefect UI → `discover` → Run, or `dc exec aibrarian-worker aibrarian discover` |
| pause transcription | Prefect UI → Deployments → `media-pipeline` → pause schedule |
| reprocess one file | `touch` it (the fingerprint changes and it goes back to `discovered`), or `UPDATE aib.media_file SET stage='audio_extracted' WHERE id=…` to redo from transcribe |
| review placement suggestions | `GET /suggestions?domain=video` → `POST /suggestions/<id>/apply` (dry run) → `?dry_run=false` |
| apply confident movie moves | `aibrarian apply --domain video --kind movie` (check the plan) → add `--apply` |
| dismiss a suggestion | `POST /suggestions/<id>/dismiss` |
| scan books now | `curl -X POST z8g4:8790/book-scan -H 'content-type: application/json' -d '{}'` |
| find a quote | `curl 'z8g4:8790/search?q=i%27ll+be+back'` |
| cut a clip | `curl -X POST z8g4:8790/clip -H 'content-type: application/json' -d '{"phrase":"I will be back","title":"Terminator"}'` → `/opt/stacks/aibrarian/data/clips/` |
| fix orphaned subtitles from old logs | `aibrarian srt-report --log …` then `aibrarian sync-subtitles --log … --apply` |
| regenerate code docs | `aibrarian gen-docs src --out docs/reference` |

## Upgrades

```bash
git pull
dc build aibrarian-api aibrarian-gpu
dc up -d          # migrations apply automatically on API/worker start (advisory-locked)
```

To add a schema change, create `src/aibrarian/migrations/00N_name.sql`. Files
apply in name order, each once, and are recorded in `aib.schema_migrations`.

## Backups

- Postgres: `dc exec postgres pg_dump -U aibrarian -Fc aibrarian > aib_$(date +%F).dump`. Prefect's DB is optional.
- Qdrant: rebuildable (re-embed), but snapshots are faster: `curl -X POST z8g4:6333/collections/movie_segments/snapshots`.
- Sidecars live next to the media and are covered by your media backup.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Check |
|---|---|
| Many `transcribe` failures with CUDA errors | `nvidia-smi` on GPU0; `dc logs aibrarian-gpu`; host driver must support CUDA 12.8 (driver ≥ 570) |
| Two whisper jobs at once or GPU OOM | run `aibrarian prefect-limits` (creates the `gpu-whisper=1` tag limit) |
| `embed`/`catalog` slow or timing out | `ollama ps` (are both models loaded?), GPU1 memory, `AIB_LLM_TIMEOUT_S` |
| Items stuck in a stage with no events | stale lease: they're reclaimed after 6 h, or `UPDATE aib.media_file SET locked_at=NULL WHERE …` |
| `needs_review` piling up | Jellyfin API key wrong (`/health` → `jellyfin:false`), or titles are unusual: review in `/suggestions` |
| Moves report `skip_dst_exists` | the target already exists; compare the files, then `aibrarian cleanup-skipped` (dry run first) |
| Sidecar write warnings | the media mount is read-only or owned by someone else; the GPU worker runs as root and chowns to match the video |
| Logs | `dc logs <svc> \| jq 'select(.level=="error")'` (JSON lines) |

## Quote search by movie title

- UI: `http://<host>:8790/search/ui` (title box autocompletes from transcribed movies only).
- `GET /search?q=...&title=...` (also `/search/text`, `/search/semantic`): title is
  fuzzy-resolved (case/punctuation-insensitive, typos, optional `(year)`) against items
  that have transcript segments. Response stays a JSON list; the match is in headers
  `X-Resolved-Title` (URL-quoted), `X-Media-Id`, `X-Title-Score`. No match → 404,
  ambiguous (e.g. two "Alfie" films) → 422; both include `detail.suggestions`.
- `GET /titles/autocomplete?q=jump&limit=10`, `GET /titles/resolve?title=...`.
- `POST /clip` with `title` uses the same resolver.
- CLI: `aibrarian search "quote" --title "22 Jump Street (2014)"`.
